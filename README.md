Title:
Ad Creative Recognition with Computer Vision

Introduction:
In the digital era, advertisements are ubiquitous and play a vital role in content delivery and user engagement. Identifying ad creatives automatically through computer vision can streamline content moderation, ad targeting, and user experience enhancement. This project aims to develop a sophisticated computer vision solution capable of accurately distinguishing between ad creatives and non-advertisement content.

Methodology:
The methodology involves several key steps:

Data Preparation: Utilizing image datasets containing both ad creatives and non-advertisement images. Employing data augmentation techniques to increase dataset variability and improve model generalization.
Model Construction: Leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures such as InceptionV3 for feature extraction. Building a custom classification head on top of the base model to classify images as ad or non-ad.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Employing grid search with cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters such as optimizer choice and learning rate.
Model Training: Training the constructed model on the augmented image datasets to learn discriminative features for ad creative recognition.
Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Analyzing confusion matrices and classification reports to assess false positive reduction and overall effectiveness.
Testing and Prediction: Testing the trained model with unseen images to predict whether they are ad creatives or non-advertisement content.
Modules and Libraries Used:
TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for building and training neural network models.
Keras: High-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow, providing easy-to-use interfaces for model construction and training.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and evaluation.
Matplotlib: Data visualization library for plotting training curves and performance metrics.
